#Python booleans
#boolean represents on eof two values : true or false 

print("Boolean used to compare two numbers, Is 100 greater than 70 : ",100>70)

'''
   Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
   Any string is True, except empty strings.
   Any number is True, except 0.
   Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

 Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value,
 like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:
 
'''
x=350
print(isinstance(x,int))
